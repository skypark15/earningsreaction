# earningsreaction

This project analyzes how companies within the same industry react to earnings announcements by comparing stock price movements. The program tracks a target companyâ€™s post-earnings performance and automatically checks whether peer companies exhibit similar trends. By identifying correlated reactions, the tool helps surface potential option trading opportunities. Built in Python, it leverages yfinance, pandas, and data visualization to provide actionable insights for earnings-based trading strategies.
